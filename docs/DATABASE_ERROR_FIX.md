# 🚨 URGENT: Database Error Fix

## The Problem
You're getting "Database error saving new user" because the `user_profiles` table doesn't exist or has permission issues.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX

### Step 1: Run Emergency Database Setup
1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste `emergency-setup.sql`**
3. **Click "Run"** 
4. **Look for "SUCCESS" messages**

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. **Visit your deployed app**
2. **Try creating a new account**
3. **Try updating profile**

## 🎯 What the Emergency Setup Does

✅ **Creates user_profiles table** with proper structure
✅ **Sets up permissive RLS policies** (secure enough for now)
✅ **Creates avatars storage bucket** with correct permissions
✅ **Tests the setup** to ensure it works

## 🔍 Error Details

The error happens because:
- ❌ `user_profiles` table doesn't exist
- ❌ RLS policies are blocking access

## 📋 Quick Verification

After running `emergency-setup.sql`, you should see:
```
SUCCESS: user_profiles table ready
SUCCESS: Storage bucket ready  
EMERGENCY SETUP COMPLETE! ✅
```
